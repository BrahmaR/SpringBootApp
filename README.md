Simple starter app for Spring MVC (using spring boot)

Uses thymeleaf for templating, I find this template engine very easy to use and outputs clean html with error checking.
H2 or Mysql for DB, configure it via application.properties


Features:

* User Registration
* User Activation via e-mail link
* Password Reset via e-mail link
* User Admin when ROLE_ADMIN
* Edit Profile
* Upload Profile Picture
* Admins can login as other users using "Login As" link in the user editor.
New
